<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a wife. I'm a dog mom. I'm a doer. I'm also a woman of God. I'm
  sophisticated and graduated with a Bachelor's degree from George Mason
  University in 2022. I'm also a member of THE Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority,
  Incorporated.

  In the last year, I've learned a lot about technology, project and product
  management. I earned my Professional Scrum Master Certification in January of
  2023. Then, I earned my Professional Scrum Product Owner in May. Lastly, I
  earned my CAPM in Novemeber of 2023. During that time I also joined my
  illustrious sorority and have been staying active on committess and serving
  the community with my sorors!

<p>
  My current goal is to continue growing in my education and professional life.
  I plan on getting more education in the product management realm. Also, I'm in
  a webdevelopment course that is teaching me how to make this webpage. I look
  forward to making myself proud as I knock my goals out and continue putting my
  best foot forward in everything I do! With prayer and God I know that anything
  is possible!
